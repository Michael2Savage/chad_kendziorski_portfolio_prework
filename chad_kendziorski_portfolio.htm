<h2>Why Coding Temple?</h2>

<p>At the end of last year, I graduated from Ferris State University with a bachelor's in bussiness administration. 
After looking through some job options, I decided I would like to develop a technical skill that was in high demand.
I want a job that offers possible remote work and allows me to stay commited to my passions in life while I work.
I reviewed several bootcamp options and Coding Temple has great class sizes and awesome reviews. I enjoy working with technology,
and have been modifying my PSVita with custom firmware to run old PS1 games and even added a Gameboy emulator. This amoung other things
leads me to beleive that a career in tech is a good fit.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p>I have been training taekwondo for 12 years now and have taught martial arts for over 3 years. Jiu-jutsu and Taekwondo
are my favorite sports. I always find time for them! I have also been producing/writing music for about 10 years.
You can check out my Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZjHzXVLZgN7FEkwrkoxnKg">here,</a>  <br>
and you can check out my facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/therealmichaelsavage">here!</a><br>
I have also been doing more traveling lately. Just this year, I traveled to Mexico for two weeks! Travel is something I'm
excited to do more of... One more reason to work remote!</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am getting into web development because it seems like work that allows me to use my mind while allowing me the freedom
to persue other passion projects. I plan to build my personal website that hosts my music for my final project of this
program. Here are some random facts about me!</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am a coffee addict. (If everything goes right I'll have coffee every meeting day.)</li>
  <li>In addition to original music I have writen music for podcast intros and have done mashups on my Youtube channel.</li>
  <li>Last year I got my 4th degree black belt in Taekwondo!</li>
  <li>On 8/20/2021 I did a 3-night hike on North Manitou island.
  <li>My favorite artist (right now) is Run the Jewels.
</ul>
